# Image processing
This project is aimed at understanding image processing. At the end of the project, i was able to understand;
- What pixels are,
- What is an image resolution,
- How to load an image data, etc.

The project uses a subset of the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) embeded in scikit-learn for building and testing the model.
The project uses a supervised learning approach, using ensemble technique in the form of random forest.
