    "* A self driving car needs information about its surrounding to make decisions, this can come from sensors, also, a self driving car need information about its geolocation to Know how to plan its travels, and identify its currents state and position. These inputs amongst others will allow the vehicle make decisions and what signal to send to other componenets of the car, like the indicators and wheel.\n",
